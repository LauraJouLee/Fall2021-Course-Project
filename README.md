#### Topic: The Impact of COVID-19 on Streaming Music Listeners’ Behavior: Spotify

#### Background
• The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent global pandemic has radically impacted the life in the U.S and around the world. Music consumption decreased by 12.5 percent after WHO’s pandemic declaration on Mar 11, 2020. <br/>
• Streaming consumption has fallen compared to 2019 with only a 17% increase at the end of 2020. The industry is now experiencing a change in people’s behaviors. The pandemic might reduce music consumption in streaming music by restricting travel and cutting down the music-friendly activities like lockdowns and work from home activities. <br/>
• Although increased at-home activities caused an overall loss in streaming music, they also inspired new playlists for cooking, cleaning, and in-door exercising. The music behavior of people during the pandemic and lockdowns reflects the resilience of people, artists, and record companies at this difficult time.

 
#### Research Questions
• What are the changes in streaming music? <br/>
By analyzing the changes, we could see the impact of the pandemic on peoples’ music preferences. According to some annual reports, children music and country music unexpectedly showed growth during the pandemic.

• What is the impact of COVID-19 on people’s music preferences? <br/>
Would there be significant patterns or differences during the peaks of COVID cases? 
By measuring the relationship of music trends and confirmed cases, we could know whether a correlation exists between them.


#### Data Sources

• Billboard Hot100 <br/>
The Weekly Top100 Charts showed the most popular songs across all genres, ranked by radio airplay audience impressions, as measured by Nielsen Music, sales data as compiled by Nielsen Music, and streaming activity data provided by online music sources.

• Spotify API <br/>
Spotify provides access to extract music data, including artist, album and track data. The extracted data would become the metadata of the tracks in Billboard Hot 100, including genre and audio features.

• Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset <br/>
This dataset provides the daily cases, deaths, vaccinations, tests, etc. data of the world. The project would focus on the smoothed USA COVID data of daily cases, deaths, vaccinations and tests to compare the correlation of music and the pandemic. <br/>
